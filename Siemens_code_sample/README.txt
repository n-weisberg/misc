Hello!

In this folder you will find a file named real_estate.py. 
This is a python script I threw together a while ago to help me calculate the potential earnings and risks associated with investing in real estate rentals. 
Near the bottom of the file there is a dictionary containing a bunch of values like amortization, income, maxDTI, etc. 
Changing these values will result in different outputs, so feel free to play around with them.

Uncomment either runOnce() or runSimulation() at the bottom of the file, then simply run `python real_estate.py` from your terminal in this directory.
